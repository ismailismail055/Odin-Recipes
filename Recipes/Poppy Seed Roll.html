    <h1>Old World Poppy Seed Roll</h1>

    <img src="/Images/Pic 2.webp" alt="">

    <P>This poppy seed roll recipe makes two loaves of soft, sweet yeast bread swirled with a creamy homemade poppy seed filling. Growing up, my mother and aunts always made this Eastern European bread for Easter and Christmas. Looks complicated, but is easy enough to make. I like it best after the second day.</P>

    <h2><strong>INGREDIENTS</strong></h2>

        <h3>Poppy Seed Filling:</h3>
         <ul>
            <li> 1/2 pound poppy seeds</li>
            <li>3/4 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup hot milk</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter, melted</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon lemon juice</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>Bread:</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup warm water (100 degrees F/38 degrees C)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
            <li>1 (0.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour, or more if needed</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/4 cup butter</li>
            <li>1 large egg, seperated - white reserved</li>
        </ul>
    

    <h2><strong>DIRECTIONS</strong></h2>

        <H3>Step 1</H3>
            <p>Make the filling: Place poppy seeds into a food processor; process until seeds are ground, about 1 minute.</p>

        <h3>Step 2</h3>
            <p>Mix poppy seeds, 3/4 cup sugar, hot milk, 1 tablespoon melted butter, and lemon juice together in a bowl until combined; cover and refrigerate while making bread. The filling will set up and thicken as it chills.</p>

        <h3>Step 3</h3>
            <p>Make the bread: Pour warm water into a small bowl; add sugar and sprinkle yeast on top. Let stand until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 minutes</p>

        <h3>Step 4</h3>
            <p>Whisk flour and salt together in a bowl. Cut in butter with 2 knives or a pastry blender until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add yeast mixture and egg yolk; stir to make a soft dough<p>

        <h3>Step 5</h3>
            <p>Turn dough out onto a floured work surface and knead until smooth and slightly springy, about 5 minutes. If dough is too sticky, knead in more flour, about 2 tablespoons at a time. Cut dough into 2 equal pieces. Roll each piece out into a 12x16-inch rectangle.</p>

        <h3>Step 6</h3>
            <p>Spread half of the poppy seed filling over each rectangle, leaving a 1-inch border. Fold the 1-inch border back over the filling on all sides and press down. Pick up the shorter side of a dough rectangle and roll it like a jelly roll; repeat with second rectangle. Pinch ends together or tuck ends under to prevent filling from leaking out.</p>

        <h3>Step 7</h3>
            <p>Line a baking sheet with parchment paper; place filled loaves seam-side down on the baking sheet and allow to rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour.</p>

        <h3>Step 8</h3>
            <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Beat egg white in a bowl until frothy; brush loaves with beaten egg white.</p>

        <h3>Step 9</h3>
            <p>Bake in preheated oven until dark golden brown on top, 30 to 40 minutes. Remove loaves from the oven and cover with a clean kitchen towel until cool to keep crust soft. Cool completely before slicing.</p>
